# Unity Splines

Creates bezier spline curves directly in Unity using a GUI interface that mimics the Adobe pen tool. You 
can also import SVG files and the program with convert the path into Unity splines. <br>

By simply adding an animation script to a GameObject and selecting the spline, the object will animate along the curve.

### Note
---
This project is a work in progress. Some svg commands aren't yet implemented 
and the Spline Editor Window feature set is minimal at the moment.
